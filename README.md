### 🔧 **Suggestions and Future Work**

1️⃣ **Unit & Widget Testing for Critical Features**
* Current Limitation: The app currently has minimal test coverage.
* Improvement: Increase test coverage by adding:
* Unit tests for API calls, including searching for albums and artists.
* Widget tests for UI interactions like search functionality.
* Integration tests to verify how the app handles API responses and user interactions.
* Benefit: Ensures code reliability and prevents unexpected failures.


2️⃣ **UI Enhancements for Better UX**
* Current Limitation: Basic UI without animations or loading indicators.

* Improvement:

  * Add smooth transitions & animations to enhance the user experience, such as:
    * Animating the search icon inside the text field for better visual feedback.
    * Uncommenting the ripple effect on GridView and ListView items for improved UI responsiveness. 
    * Navigating users to another page when they tap on an item, allowing them to play music.
    
* Benefit: Provides a more polished and interactive experience, making the app feel smoother and more engaging, similar to Spotify.


📌 **These improvements would enhance the app's usability, reliability, and visual appeal. 
Given more time, implementing these changes would greatly improve the user experience. 🚀**
